The robo advisor for DIY S&P 500 indexing that nobody asked for - in PowerShell.

DIY indexing is pointless for most of you - buying VOO (S&P 500) or VT (total US market) will give you similar results with much less headache.

However, if like me, you are a US citizen living in the EU, this is sadly not possible. Your US brokerage will not sell you ETFs if they know that you live in the EU, and few EU brokerages will have anything to do with you when they find out that you're a US citizen, and even if they will take your money, you do NOT want to deal with PFIC taxes on non-US-domiciled funds.

You can still buy individual stocks. So, DIY.

This tool will help you find the closest approximation of the S&P 500 for a given amount of money, transaction cost and desired expense ratio.
